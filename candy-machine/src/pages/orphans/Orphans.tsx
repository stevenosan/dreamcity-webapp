              <p>So you wanna join a gang? This is where most start. Young, vast numbers, and ruthless. They&#x27;re not to be trusted. An Orphan of Dream City is the type of person that would steal anything that&#x27;s not nailed down.</p>
              <p>Most of The Orphans go on to be normal citizens of Dream City if they aren&#x27;t arrested or killed. The talented among the group begin their life of crime and graduate to more formidable gangs.</p>
              <p>Will you join them or cut through their ranks?</p>
