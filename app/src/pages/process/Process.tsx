                    <h3>Part 1: The prompt</h3>
                    We set the ground work for you. Nobody really likes to work from a blank canvas. We provide a prompt and some details. You fill in the void.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>Part 2: The vote</h3>
                    Holders of the NFT for Dream City will vote on their favorite stories. The community will help drive and shape the world of Dream City.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>Part 3: The craft</h3>
                    Writers and Artists will pair up and work on the winning story. It’ll be included in the anthology comic with other stories.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>FUTURE: The gift</h3>
                    Ideally, we’d like to be able to reward people for their efforts. We have a few ideas, Royalties, Tokens, and Air Drops to name a few. More details TBA.

                <h2>What Else?</h2>
                <p className="subhead">all of that sounds like future work</p>
                <p>It mostly is. For right now, we have a free prologue comic and another couple of holder-gated short stories in the works. We also have A LOT of lore written and ready to publish which will also be free to view.</p>
                <h2>other things you should know</h2>
                <p className="subhead">we work slow on purpose</p>
                <p>Everyone that’s currently on the team has a full-time day job. This is a passion project for us. We want to be nimble, but we also want time to consider options and how it impacts or helps fulfill our vision. </p>
                <p className="subhead">we value inclusivity</p>
                <p>We want everyone to feel welcome in our community. Additionally everyone should feel as though whatever Dream City character they’re embodying it would be welcome in our ficticious world.</p>
