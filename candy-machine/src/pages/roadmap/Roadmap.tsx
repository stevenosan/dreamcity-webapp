          <p>We&#x27;re super excited to be sharing our project with you. However, we don&#x27;t want to get ahead of ourselves right now. Our team is huge nerds about cyberpunk in all formats comics, video games, TTRPGs, you know, all the typical nerd stuff. We currently don&#x27;t have the experience to commit to a game or TTRPG. We would love to promise that, but we believe in being transparent about what we&#x27;re capable of delivering. Throughout the project, we&#x27;ll be revisiting the Road Map and making updates to it as the project, team, and community grow.</p>
