                <p className="subhead">That’s a lot of jargon. How does it work?</p>
                <p>The Dream City team has come up with a few short stories to introduce community members to the world of Dream City.</p>
                <p>We’ve also created lore around the inhabitants and places you’re likely to find yourself. Gangs, their leaders, Corporations, Corp CEOs, and City Districts. That’s the Dream City Sandbox.</p>
                <p>The NFT is the access to play in the sandbox and contribute to the comic anthology.</p>
                <p className="subhead">ok Cool. but I’m not a writer or an artist though?</p>
                <p>No problem, even if you just have an idea we have writers and artists to help bring your idea to life. All you need is an active imagination. Keep scrolling to see the process below.</p>
